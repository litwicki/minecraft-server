# Minecraft Server

A simple Amplify app that runs Lambda functions on a schedule for enabling/disabling a EC2 instance (in this case one running Minecraft).

## Getting Started

- [Setup your own Minecraft Server on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/run-your-own-minecraft-server/)
- [Install and configure Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install#pre-requisites-for-installation)

## Setup Scheduler

This simple app will install a Lambda to START and a Lambda to STOP your Minecraft server at a schedule you configure (see below).
